	<BookRiparius.description>Tiberium Riparius.\n\nThe green kind of Tiberium is the most common one.\n\nIt came to planet Earth a long time ago, long before this rim world has been infected.\n\nThis kind spreads the quickest, infecting big areas within days.\n\nSo be careful if you encounter any!\n\nAvoid touching it no matter the cost.\n\nThe substance, no matter the kind, will infect any carbon based lifeform and crystalize it.\n\nThis ability makes it highly toxic.\n\nTiberium is an unkown type of mineral that converts anything and everything that is carbon-based around itself into Tiberium.\n\nThis happens due to reactions between Tiberium nuclei and the other material's nuclei.</BookRiparius.description>

	<BookVinifera.description>Tiberium Vinifera.\n\nThe blue kind of Tiberium, it is the "mature" form of green Tiberium as it evolved.\n\nIt is rare compared to the green Tiberium.\n\nThis kind spreads more slowly in comparision.\n\nBe careful if you encounter any as it is still toxic!\n\nThis type explains the theory that Tiberium is more of a living being.\n\nTiberium in general mutates any life if it did not kill it at first.\n\nThese Tiberium lifeforms feed on Tiberium if they are animals, or spread it, if they are plants.\n\nIt is still unproven how much of living being Tiberium is.\n\nFurther investigation is needed.</BookVinifera.description>
