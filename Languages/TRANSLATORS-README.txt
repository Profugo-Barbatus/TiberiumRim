Thank you for volunteering your time and skill to help Tiberium Rim reach as wide an audience as possible!

It's through your efforts that others can enjoy this, and to make this a bit easier, we have provided this english base file for you to use. All you'll need to do is copy the English Language folder, and rename the copy to the language you are translating to. From there, its as simple as going through the files in the keyed and defInjected folders, and replacing the text with your translations.
